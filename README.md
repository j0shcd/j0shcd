<h3 align="center">Data Science | Product | Startups | Machine Learning </h3>

<p>I'm an EPFL engineer and tech enthusiast with a passion for product innovation and data, currently pursuing a Master's in Technology Management and Data Science after a Bachelor's in Microengineering.
</br></br>
During my studies at EPFL, I have spent time building rockets for the <a href="https://epflrocketteam.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EPFL Rocket Team</a>, been President at the <a href="https://www.ec-epfl-unil.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Entrepreneur Club</a> and Managing Partner at student-led VC fund <a href="https://www.campus.founderful.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Founderful Campus</a>. I also worked for <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/neuromorphic-computing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intel Labs</a> as a Software Engineer and for <a href="https://www.daav.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DAAV</a> on Business Development.
</br></br>
Outside of my professional pursuits, I enjoy exploring nature, photography, and cooking.
</br></br>
I'm currently on the lookout for a place to complete my master's internship, preferably in a product management or data scientist role. Please feel free to <a href="https://joshuacohendumani.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">teach out</a> if you are interested in chatting!</p>
